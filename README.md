AnalyzeSkeleton
===============
This plugin tags all pixel/voxels in a skeleton image and then counts all its junctions, triple and quadruple points and branches, and measures their average and maximum length. The tags are shown in a new window displaying every tag in a different color. You can find it under `Plugins`>`Skeleton`>`Analyze Skeleton (2D/3D)`.
